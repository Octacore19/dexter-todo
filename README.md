*** Features Not Included
1. Animations - I have loved to add transition animations, and gestures animations to the UI to improve User Experience.
2. Color/Material Color - I didn't get to add so much color to the design.
3. Adding of New Residents/Patients - I preloaded my firebase db with some random patient data, would have to loved to have an interface on the mobile app where the user/nurse can register in a new patient.
